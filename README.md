Home Automation Project
This project is a personal project to implement domotic in any home.

This project idea is to divide the project in 4 big components:

1- A desktop application with which the admin and users can control everything (depending on their permissions):
  - Create/Update/Delete users
  - Create/Update/Delete devices
  - Operate the different devices
  - Obtain statistics 

2- A web interface with with which the admin and users can control everything (depending on their permissions)

3- Device hardware and software using the Esp8266 family

4- Software embebed in a Raspberry to establish the communication between the application, web interface and devices.
